## CV Generator
CV Generator made with React.

## Description
CV Generator where a user can add typical CV/resume information such as past experience, education, skills, etc. to a React page with a CV structured format.

## Why?
The main purpose of this project was to practice using React and splitting up pieces of a page into React components. To be clear this project is not complete, it was used to help cement in some concepts, but was not fully finished.

## TODO
- Clean up the styling/add styling to more closely resemble an actual CV
- General/various bug fixes
- Add an option to download the finished CV as a pdf
